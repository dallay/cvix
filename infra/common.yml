# Networks are defined here for standalone usage of individual compose files
# (e.g., running postgresql-compose.yml or keycloak-compose.yml independently)
#
# When these files are included by app.yml, the network definitions are inherited
# from app.yml to prevent conflicts. Docker Compose merges network definitions
# from all included files, using the first definition it encounters.
