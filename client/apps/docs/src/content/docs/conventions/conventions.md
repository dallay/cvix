## Conventions

Quick guidelines to keep the repository consistent.

## Naming and length limits

- Use descriptive names for packages and modules.
- Centralize limits (for example, max name lengths) in shared values.

## Code formatting

 JS/TS: follow Biome and ESLint where applicable.

## Commits and PRs

- Add a clear PR description and reference related issues.

## Tests

- Add unit tests for critical logic.
- Large PRs should include basic tests and a manual verification guide.

Add more conventions (naming, branch strategy, release process) as your team requires.
