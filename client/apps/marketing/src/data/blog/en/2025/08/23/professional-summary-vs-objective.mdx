The introductory section is crucial because recruiters only spend a few seconds on the initial review. This section must immediately establish your value proposition. The contemporary standard favors the **Professional Summary** over the Objective Statement.

## Why Avoid the Objective?

The traditional objective is largely considered obsolete. It focuses on the applicant's personal goals ("This is what I want"), consumes valuable space, and states an obvious fact: that you are applying for the job.

## The Superiority of the Professional Summary

The Professional Summary shifts the focus from the applicant's needs to the company's needs, answering the question: **"What can this candidate do for us?"**.

It should be a strategic 3-5 sentence sales pitch that highlights your strongest qualifications immediately.

**Strategic Content of the Summary**:

*   **Job Title and Years of Experience:** E.g., "Sales Manager with 6 years of experience...".
*   **Key Skills and Relevant Certifications:** Mention 2-3 strengths that match the job description.
*   **Important Achievements or Results:** Include a measurable achievement that demonstrates impact.
*   **Industry Keywords:** Incorporate terms from the job posting to optimize for ATS reading.

**Recommendation:** The summary is ideal for experienced professionals applying to the same field. If you are changing careers or are a recent graduate, a modernized objective or a summary focused on transferable skills may work, but it must still focus on the value you will bring to the company.
