# Feature Specification: Resume Generator MVP

**Feature Branch**: `003-resume-generator-mvp`
**Created**: October 31, 2025
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Resume Generator MVP - Technical Specification v1.0"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Basic Resume Generation (Priority: P1)

A professional user needs to create a high-quality, ATS-optimized resume without learning LaTeX syntax. They fill out a web form with their information and receive a professionally formatted PDF within seconds.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition - democratizing access to professional resume generation. Without this, there is no product.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by filling out the web form with sample data, clicking generate, and verifying a valid PDF is downloaded. Delivers immediate value: a professional resume without technical knowledge.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user visits the resume generator landing page, **When** they click "Create Resume", **Then** they see a form with fields for personal information, experience, education, and skills
2. **Given** a user has filled all required form fields with valid data, **When** they click "Generate PDF", **Then** the system generates and returns a downloadable PDF within 8 seconds
3. **Given** a user has successfully generated a resume, **When** they open the PDF, **Then** the resume displays professional typography, proper formatting, and all entered information accurately
4. **Given** a user is filling out the form, **When** they navigate away and return, **Then** their progress is preserved for the current session

---

### User Story 2 - Form Validation and Error Handling (Priority: P1)

A user filling out the resume form makes mistakes or skips required fields. The system provides clear, immediate feedback to help them correct issues before submission.

**Why this priority**: Essential for user experience and preventing failed generations. A 75% completion rate depends on this.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by intentionally submitting incomplete or invalid form data and verifying appropriate error messages appear. Delivers value by preventing wasted time on failed generations.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user attempts to generate a resume, **When** they have left required fields empty, **Then** the system displays field-specific error messages indicating which fields need completion
2. **Given** a user enters invalid data (e.g., non-email format in email field), **When** they move to the next field, **Then** the system validates the field and shows an appropriate error message
3. **Given** a user has corrected validation errors, **When** they resubmit the form, **Then** error messages disappear and generation proceeds
4. **Given** the form is being validated, **When** validation occurs, **Then** it happens without blocking the user interface

---

### User Story 3 - Real-time Preview (Priority: P2)

A user wants to see how their resume will look before generating the final PDF. They can preview formatting and layout as they fill out the form to make adjustments.

**Why this priority**: Significantly improves user confidence and reduces iteration cycles, but the core value (PDF generation) works without it.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by filling form fields and observing a live preview panel update. Delivers value by allowing users to iterate on content before committing to PDF generation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is filling out the form, **When** they complete a section, **Then** the preview updates to show how that information will appear in the final resume
2. **Given** a user modifies existing form data, **When** they make changes, **Then** the preview updates within 500ms to reflect the changes
3. **Given** a user is viewing the preview, **When** they are on a mobile device, **Then** the preview is responsive and readable

---

### User Story 4 - Mobile-Responsive Experience (Priority: P2)

A user accessing the resume generator from a mobile device can complete the entire form and generate their resume using a phone or tablet interface.

**Why this priority**: Expands accessibility and user base, but desktop experience covers the core use case.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by accessing the application on a 375px viewport and completing the full form submission. Delivers value by enabling resume creation from any device.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user accesses the site from a mobile device, **When** they view the form, **Then** all form fields are properly sized and accessible
2. **Given** a user is filling the form on mobile, **When** they interact with form fields, **Then** the keyboard displays appropriate input types (email keyboard for email fields, etc.)
3. **Given** a user completes the form on mobile, **When** they generate the PDF, **Then** the download process works correctly on their mobile browser

---

### User Story 5 - Error Recovery and Retry (Priority: P3)

When PDF generation fails due to system issues, the user receives clear information about what went wrong and can easily retry without re-entering all their information.

**Why this priority**: Improves robustness but should rarely be needed if the system is stable. The <3% error rate target means this affects few users.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by simulating system errors (timeout, resource limits) and verifying error messages and retry functionality work. Delivers value by preventing data loss on errors.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the PDF generation times out, **When** the error occurs, **Then** the user sees a clear message explaining the timeout and offering a "Retry" button
2. **Given** compilation fails due to template issues, **When** the occurs, **Then** the user sees a helpful error message without technical LaTeX details
3. **Given** a user clicks "Retry" after an error, **When** the retry is initiated, **Then** the form retains all previously entered data

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user enters extremely long text that could break formatting (e.g., 500-character job description)?
- How does the system handle special characters or non-ASCII characters in names (e.g., accented characters, Chinese characters)?
- What happens if a user attempts to generate multiple resumes simultaneously from the same browser?
- How does the system respond when Docker container resources are exhausted (all containers in use)?
- What happens if the LaTeX compilation produces warnings but still generates a valid PDF?
- How does the system handle users attempting to exploit LaTeX injection vulnerabilities?
