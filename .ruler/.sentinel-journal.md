## 2026-01-05 - Security Enhancement - Frontend - Cross-Origin Policy Hardening

**Location:** `client/apps/webapp/Caddyfile`
**Issue:** The web application's security headers were robust but could be enhanced to further mitigate cross-origin attacks.
**Fix:** Added the `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy "same-origin"` header to the Caddyfile. This header instructs the browser to isolate the browsing context, preventing documents from different origins from interacting, which helps defend against attacks like Spectre.
**Prevention:** Regularly review and update security headers in line with modern best practices (e.g., recommendations from OWASP, Mozilla).
