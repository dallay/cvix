The Skills section is fundamental for ATS optimization, as most recruiters filter candidates by skills. For this section to be effective, it must be strategic, organized, and focused on what is relevant.

### Difference between Hard and Soft Skills

It is crucial to understand the difference and know what to prioritize:

*   **Hard Skills:** These are technical and quantifiable knowledge acquired through experience or education (e.g., programming languages, software, accounting, Google Analytics). These should be the focus of your Skills section.
*   **Soft Skills:** These are attributes related to behavior and communication (e.g., creativity, teamwork, problem-solving). Companies value them, but they are often devalued on a resume because everyone lists them.

**Recommendation:** Include more **hard skills than soft skills** in the Skills section. Soft skills should be demonstrated through your achievements and the context of your work experience, rather than simply being listed. Avoid empty words or clichés like "team player" or "detail-oriented."

### Categorization and Proficiency Level

To maximize clarity, it is beneficial to categorize your skills (e.g., Technical Skills, Marketing Skills, Languages).

You can add your proficiency level next to each skill to give the recruiter context:
*   **Beginner:** Some knowledge and experience.
*   **Intermediate:** Good level of understanding and previous use at work.
*   **Advanced:** Fully proficient, used extensively, and can train others.
*   **Expert:** Extensive use in multiple projects and organizations, able to give advice to other professionals.

**Ensure that all listed skills are relevant to the position you are applying for**.
