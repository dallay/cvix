## Frontend Security Enhancements

### 2024-05-22: Stricter Content Security Policy (CSP) in Webapp

- **Severity:** ✨ Security Enhancement
- **Vulnerability:** The default Content Security Policy in the `webapp`'s `Dockerfile` allowed `'unsafe-inline'` for scripts and styles, which could an attacker to execute malicious scripts (XSS).
- **Impact:** By removing `'unsafe-inline'`, we reduce the risk of XSS attacks by ensuring that only trusted scripts and styles are executed.
- **Verification:** The changes were applied to `client/apps/webapp/Dockerfile`. Future developers should use CSP hashes for any required inline resources.
