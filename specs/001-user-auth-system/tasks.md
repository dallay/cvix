### Dependencies

1. User Story 1 → User Story 2
2. User Story 2 → User Story 3, User Story 4
3. User Story 4 → User Story 5
4. User Story 5 → User

### Parallel Execution Examples

- T011, T017, T023, T026, T030, T032 can be implemented in parallel as they target different user stories and files.
- T013, T019, T027, T034 can be implemented in parallel as they target different backend commands.

### MVP Scope

- User Story 1: User Registration with Email/Password
- User Story 2: User Login with Email/Password
