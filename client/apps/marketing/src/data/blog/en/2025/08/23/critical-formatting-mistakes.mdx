Even a well-written resume can be rejected if it contains formatting errors, as these distract the recruiter or prevent the ATS from processing the information correctly.

### Fatal Errors in Content and Language:

1.  **Grammatical and Spelling Errors:** These are the number one cause of rejection. The ATS will not recognize misspelled words.
2.  **Passive Language:** Using passive voice instead of strong action verbs weakens the impact of your achievements.
3.  **Not Demonstrating Results:** Focusing on duties instead of quantifiable achievements is one of the biggest mistakes.
4.  **Missing or Incorrect Contact Information:** If the recruiter cannot contact you, all the effort is useless.
5.  **Use of Personal Pronouns:** Avoid "I" or "We".

### Technical Formatting Errors (Avoid ATS Failures):

1.  **Overly Creative Design:** Avoid complex layouts, flashy colors, graphics, photos, tables, or multiple columns, as they confuse the ATS and distract the recruiter.
2.  **Headers and Footers with Critical Information:** The ATS may ignore text in these areas; place contact information in the main body.
3.  **Inconsistent Dates:** Mixing formats (e.g., "Jan 2022–Mar 2023" and "1/2022–3/2023") confuses the ATS. Use a uniform and complete format (month and year).
4.  **Non-Standard Section Titles:** Use "Work Experience" instead of "Professional Journey".
5.  **Uncommon or Small Fonts:** Use standard fonts (Arial, Calibri) in a readable size (10-12 points).
