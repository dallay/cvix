Modern hiring philosophy demands that applicants replace passive descriptions of past duties with compelling evidence of achievements and impact. The biggest mistake to avoid is simply listing job responsibilities instead of highlighting results.

### The Power of Quantification

Hiring managers analyze past performance to forecast your future contribution, and metrics help demonstrate your value clearly and memorably.

Instead of vague claims like "Improved efficiency," use specific data, figures, percentages, or defined timelines. For example, instead of "Managed a team," write **"Led a team of 5 analysts, which increased department productivity by 20% in one quarter."** Even in roles without direct financial impact (like research or HR), quantify in terms of scope, efficiency, quality, or time (e.g., "Managed an annual budget of $500K" or "Decreased new employee onboarding time by 10 days").

### The XYZ Formula: Impact Structure

To articulate achievements efficiently, the XYZ formula is recommended:

**Achieved [X] (The Result/Achievement), as measured by [Y] (The Quantifiable Data), by doing [Z] (The Skills/Actions Used).**

Each point should begin with a **strong action verb** in the active voice, followed by the result and the metric.

### The Mastery of Action Verbs

The language used must be specific and in the **active voice**. The active voice directs attention to your personal contribution and uses fewer words, freeing up valuable space. Avoid passive phrases like "I was responsible for" or "The promotion was awarded to me."

Use dynamic verbs appropriate for the function (examples):
*   **Leadership:** *Coordinated*, *Supervised*, *Directed*, *Strengthened*, *Managed*.
*   **Research:** *Analyzed*, *Investigated*, *Evaluated*, *Systematized*.
*   **Technical:** *Designed*, *Programmed*, *Built*, *Optimized*, *Improved*.
*   **Strong Achievements:** *Accelerated*, *Doubled*, *Initiated*, *Pioneered*, *Reduced*, *Transformed*.
