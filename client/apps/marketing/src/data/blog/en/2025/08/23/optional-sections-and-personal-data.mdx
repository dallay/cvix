After including the five essential sections, you can add optional sections to stand out from other qualified candidates, as long as the content is relevant and you have space (ideally, keeping the resume to one or two pages).

### Optional Sections to Add Value:

*   **Languages:** An additional language can be an advantage, especially if it is relevant to the position (e.g., customer support).
*   **Volunteering Experience:** Shows passion and can count as work experience, which is useful if you are a recent graduate with no formal experience. Structure the entries with the organization's name, location, time period, and relevant tasks/achievements.
*   **Projects:** Include practical projects (thesis, side projects, blogs). This shows that you are a curious and proactive person.
*   **Extracurricular Activities:** Useful for recent graduates; they show that you are active and engaged, highlighting skills like teamwork and organization.
*   **Certifications & Awards:** Certify your skills and add credibility.

### Personal Data and Mandatory Exclusions (U.S. Context)

For applications in the U.S. market, it is essential to adhere to a standard that mitigates bias and complies with regulations.

**You must strictly exclude**:
*   **Headshot:** You should not include a photo, as it can raise concerns about unconscious bias or discrimination. Over 80% of recruiters in the U.S. will discard a resume with a photo for these concerns.
*   **References:** It is not necessary to list references or include the note "References available upon request".
*   **Sensitive Information:** Avoid including your age, gender, marital status, or details of nationality or religion.
*   **Full Address:** Providing only the city and state is sufficient; omit the full mailing address for privacy and to save space.
