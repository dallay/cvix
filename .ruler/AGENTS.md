# Project Overview

This is a production-ready monorepo template for building SaaS applications. It includes a Spring Boot + Kotlin backend, modern frontend apps (Vite / Astro / Vue), and standardized infrastructure with Docker Compose. The goal is to provide a solid foundation for engineering teams to build upon, with batteries-included for CI, linting, testing, and security.

## Agent Temporary Files

> All agents that need to create temporary files (tracking, journal, scratch, drafts, etc.) must do so exclusively in the `temporal-docs/` folder located at the root of the repository.

- The `temporal-docs/` folder is included in `.gitignore` and is not versioned in Git.
- No temporary file generated by agents should be created outside of `temporal-docs/`.
- This convention applies to any type of temporary file, including logs, drafts, tracking files, etc.
- If a temporary file requires persistence or manual review, it should be documented in the folder's README.
- Permanent or reference files must be placed in the official documentation folders (`.ruler/`, `docs/`, etc.).
