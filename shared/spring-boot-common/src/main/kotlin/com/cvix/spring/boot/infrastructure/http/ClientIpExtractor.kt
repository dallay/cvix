/**
 * Utility for extracting and validating client IP addresses from HTTP requests.
 *
 * Provides secure IP extraction from request headers (X-Forwarded-For, X-Real-IP)
 * with validation to prevent DNS resolution attacks and ensure data integrity.
 *
 * Security Features:
 * - Pre-filters IP strings to contain only valid IP address characters (hex digits, dots, colons)
 * - Prevents DNS resolution of hostnames which could lead to DoS via thread exhaustion
 * - Handles IPv6 address normalization (e.g., "::1" vs "0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1")
 * - Falls back to direct remote address from connection when headers are missing or invalid
 *
 * Usage:
 * ```kotlin
 * val clientIp = ClientIpExtractor.extract(request)
 * ```

     * 2. Reject IPv4-like strings (contains dots but doesn't match strict pattern) to prevent
     *    InetAddress.getByName from accepting shorthand forms like "192.168.1" → "192.168.0.1".
     * 3. Reject bare numbers without dots/colons (InetAddress interprets "192" as "0.0.0.192").
     * 4. Character pre-filter: allow only hex digits, dots, colons and percent (for IPv6 scope ids).
     * 5. IPv6 parsing: attempt to parse with InetAddress after the pre-filter to verify correctness.
     *    We avoid calling getByName on arbitrary hostnames because that can perform DNS resolution;
     *    the character pre-filter prevents hostnames here.
     *
     * @param ip The IP address string to validate.
     * @return true if the string is a valid IP address format, false otherwise.
