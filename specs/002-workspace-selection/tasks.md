# Tasks: Workspace Selection Implementation

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-workspace-selection/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

**Tests**: TDD approach explicitly requested - tests written FIRST before implementation

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

Based on plan.md, all frontend code lives in:

- `client/apps/webapp/src/workspace/` - Feature root
- `client/e2e/` - E2E tests

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational completion - Can run independently
- **User Story 2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on Foundational completion - Can run independently (but often builds on US1)
- **User Story 3 (Phase 5)**: Depends on Foundational completion - Can run independently (enhances US1 & US2)
- **Polish (Phase 6)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Independent - No dependencies on other stories (only Foundational)
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Integrates with User Story 1 (uses store, composables) but independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Enhances User Story 1 & 2 (adds loading/error UI) but independently testable

### Within Each User Story (TDD Workflow)

1. **Tests FIRST** üß™ - Write all tests for the story (they will fail)
2. **Verify RED** üî¥ - Confirm tests fail as expected
3. **Implementation** ‚ôªÔ∏è - Implement functionality to make tests pass
4. **Verify GREEN** ‚úÖ - Confirm all tests pass
5. **Refactor** (if needed) - Clean up code while keeping tests green

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: All T001-T007 can run in parallel (different directories)
- **Phase 2 (Foundational Tests)**: T008-T012 can run in parallel (different files)
- **Phase 2 (Foundational Implementation)**: T013-T019 can run in parallel (different files)
- **Phase 3 (US1 Tests)**: T020-T024 can run in parallel (different files)
- **Phase 4 (US2 Tests)**: T035-T041 can run in parallel (different files)
- **Phase 4 (US2 Components)**: T047 can run in parallel with other tasks (independent file)
- **Phase 5 (US3 Tests)**: T053-T057 can run in parallel (different files)
- **Phase 5 (US3 Components)**: T058-T059 can run in parallel (different files)
- **Phase 6 (Polish)**: T068-T076, T078 can run in parallel (different concerns)

**Team Strategy**: Once Foundational phase completes, all 3 user stories can be worked on in parallel by different developers.

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 Tests

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together (TDD - write first):
Task: "Write tests for WorkspaceSelectionService.determineWorkspaceToLoad()"
Task: "Write tests for workspaceApiClient.getAllWorkspaces()"
Task: "Write tests for workspaceStore.loadWorkspaces() action"
Task: "Write tests for useWorkspaceLoader composable"
Task: "Write E2E test for auto-load on login"
```

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 Implementation

```bash
# After tests are RED, launch implementation tasks together:
Task: "Implement WorkspaceSelectionService.determineWorkspaceToLoad()"
Task: "Implement workspaceApiClient.getAllWorkspaces()"
# Note: T027-T029 (store) must be sequential (same file)
# Note: T030 depends on T025-T029 completing (uses their outputs)
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. ‚úÖ Complete Phase 1: Setup (7 tasks)
2. ‚úÖ Complete Phase 2: Foundational (12 tasks - CRITICAL)
3. ‚úÖ Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (15 tasks)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
   - Run unit tests: `pnpm test -- workspace`
   - Run E2E test: `pnpm test:e2e -- "auto-load"`
   - Manual test: Log in and verify workspace auto-loads
5. **Deploy/Demo if ready** ‚Üí MVP delivers immediate value!

### Incremental Delivery

1. ‚úÖ Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready (19 tasks)
2. ‚úÖ Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (15 tasks) **MVP!**
3. ‚úÖ Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (18 tasks)
4. ‚úÖ Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (15 tasks)
5. ‚úÖ Polish ‚Üí Final release (12 tasks)

Each story adds value without breaking previous stories.

### Parallel Team Strategy

With 3 developers after Foundational phase completes:

- **Developer A**: User Story 1 (Auto-load) - 15 tasks
- **Developer B**: User Story 2 (Manual selection) - 18 tasks
- **Developer C**: User Story 3 (Loading feedback) - 15 tasks

Stories complete and integrate independently. Merge in priority order: US1 ‚Üí US2 ‚Üí US3.

---

## Test Coverage Goals

Per constitution (Principle II: TDD):

- **Target**: 75% minimum code coverage (frontend)
- **Breakdown**:
  - Domain layer: 100% (pure business logic)
  - Application layer (composables): 90%
  - Infrastructure layer: 80%
  - Presentation layer (components): 70%

**Validation**:

```bash
pnpm test:coverage -- workspace
# Should show ‚â•75% overall coverage
```

---

## Notes

- **[P]** tasks = different files, no dependencies within phase
- **[Story]** label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- **TDD workflow**: Tests FIRST üß™ ‚Üí Implementation üî¥ ‚Üí Refactor ‚ôªÔ∏è ‚Üí Green ‚úÖ
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Run `pnpm check` before committing to ensure linting passes
