Determining the length of your resume is a strategic move that should be based on your experience level, not an arbitrary rule. Although the one-page myth persists, the modern standard, especially in a professional context, leans toward two pages.

### Length Guidelines by Professional Level

*   **Recent Graduates / Entry-Level (0-5 years):** One page is strict and mandatory. Recruiters prefer concise, easy-to-scan resumes. Brevity forces a focus on the most relevant academic experience and projects.
*   **Mid-Career and Senior Professionals (5+ years):** Two pages is the accepted standard and often necessary. If the content on the second page is not relevant or is limited to basic responsibilities, you should revert to a single page.
*   **Executives / Federal / Academic (10+ years):** Two pages is the standard, although it can extend to three in rare and highly specialized cases (such as in executive or scientific roles with extensive publications). The content should focus on the last 10 or 15 years, omitting or summarizing older experiences to maintain relevance.

**Key Considerations:** A shorter, but impact-filled, resume is easier to scan. If you are struggling to fit within the two-page limit, avoid filler content and focus on describing each position with 3-5 bullet points that emphasize achievements.

**Formatting Tip for Saving Space:** You can slightly reduce the font size to 10 or 10.5 points, or decrease the margins to 0.5 inches, as long as you ensure the document remains easy to read.
