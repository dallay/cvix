**Location:** `server/engine/src/main/kotlin/com/cvix/authentication/infrastructure/SecurityConfiguration.kt`
**Issue:** The `/management/prometheus` actuator endpoint was publicly exposed via a `.permitAll()` rule, potentially leaking sensitive internal application metrics and operational data.
**Fix:** Removed the specific `permitAll()` rule for the `/management/prometheus` path. Access now defaults to the more restrictive `/management/**` rule, which requires ADMIN authority.
**Prevention:** Regularly audit Spring Security configurations to ensure sensitive actuator endpoints have appropriate authentication and authorization controls. Avoid blanket `permitAll()` rules on management endpoints.
