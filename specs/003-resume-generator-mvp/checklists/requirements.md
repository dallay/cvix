# Specification Quality Checklist: Resume Generator MVP

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: October 31, 2025
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: âœ… PASSED (Iteration 1)
**Date**: October 31, 2025

All checklist items have been addressed:

1. **Content Quality**: Specification refactored to remove technical implementation details (Docker, Spring Boot, Vue.js, etc.) and replace with business-focused descriptions
2. **Technology Agnostic**: Requirements now describe WHAT the system must do, not HOW it should be implemented
3. **Stakeholder Friendly**: Technical jargon replaced with clear business language accessible to non-technical stakeholders
4. **Complete**: All mandatory sections present with meaningful content

The specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` (if needed) or `/speckit.plan`.

## Notes

The specification was successfully revised to:

- Remove specific technology references (Vue.js, Spring Boot, Kotlin, Docker, StringTemplate, pdflatex, etc.)
- Replace technical implementation details with capability descriptions
- Maintain all functional requirements while making them technology-agnostic
- Preserve measurable success criteria and acceptance scenarios
- Keep dependencies section focused on required capabilities rather than specific tools
