## Project Overview

The Resume Generator is a streamlined platform that empowers users to craft polished, professional résumés through a guided, intuitive experience. Instead of fighting with complex editors or rigid templates, users simply provide their information once and select a visual style that fits their personal brand. The system automatically assembles the content into a clean, structured layout while maintaining consistency, readability, and modern design standards.

The platform focuses on speed, quality, and reliability: users can create multiple résumé versions tailored to different job applications, maintain a living profile with their career history, and export final documents in high-fidelity formats. Templates follow proven best practices for hiring funnels and applicant tracking systems, ensuring maximum impact across both human and automated screening.

The result is a simple, elegant tool that turns raw career data into a compelling, professionally crafted résumé—without requiring design skills, formatting knowledge, or technical experience.
