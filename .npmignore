# NOTE: Scope
# This .npmignore is maintained at the repository root. It is intended to control what is included
# when publishing a package from the repository root (if you publish from the root). Individual
# workspace packages (for example under `client/` or other package directories) should maintain
# their own `.npmignore` files or use the `files` field in their `package.json` if they are
# published separately. Keep this file focused on repository-wide exclusions.
